# 🚀 DLT-Study

Welcome to **DLT-Study**! This project is designed for experimentation with the Python library [dlt](https://dlthub.com/). It is based on the official tutorial: [REST API Tutorial](https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/rest-api).

## 📚 About

This repository contains code and pipelines to explore and learn how to use the `dlt` library for data ingestion from REST APIs. The main focus is on hands-on experimentation and learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- [dlt](https://dlthub.com/)
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## 📦 Setup & Installation

To get started, make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
3. Run the pipeline script:
   ```bash
   python rest_api_pipeline.py
   ```
4. Show the pipeline data:
   ```bash
   dlt pipeline rest_api_pokemon show
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `rest_api_pipeline.py` — Main pipeline script
- `rest_api_pokemon.duckdb` — DuckDB database generated by the pipeline
- `pyproject.toml` & `poetry.lock` — Poetry configuration files

## 📝 Notes

- This project is for learning and experimentation purposes.
- You can modify the pipeline or add new sources as you explore dlt features.
- The `.duckdb` files are not versioned (see `.gitignore`).
